## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I'm going to build a inventory tracker. Small business owners often face the task of juggling many roles. By streamlining the inventory tracking process it would improve sales, record keeping, ordering and shipping/receiving of product. I was inspired to build this project due to fact that my inventory is sourced from multiple suppliers and having everything all in one location would save a ton of time.

### Features
Sign In: The project will allow the user to create and be directed to there own personal page where they can add products. This is useful due to fact that there are drasticly different departments (ie; Optics, Rifle Parts). The personal home will allow feature all of my suppliers for ease of ordering, shipping ETA, profit margin, etc.

### Technologies

Diving deeper into MySQL, Further experimentation with Front End Design, Possible incorpation of data feeds from suppliers
